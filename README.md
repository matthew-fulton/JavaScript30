# JavaScript30
This repository contains my work on the JavaScript30 challenge, hosted by Wes Bos. The JavaScript code is my work, largely following the tutorials on the site, while the html and css was created by the host.
JavaScript30 is a 30 day challenge to create 30 projects using Vanilla JavaScript. The projects range from core site functionality to speech recognition and simple games. This was my first experience using JavaScript.
